# Qirui Zheng (Sara)

Hi! I'm Sara, a current student at UCSD majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, with a minor in Business Economics. I am interested in the intersection of Data Science with other domains. Currently looking to pursue the path of Deep Learning and or Brain Computer Interfaces. The current algorithms are modeled to align with the neuro system in the brain, it contains many more potentials yet to be discovered.

Apart from acedemics, I practice sports in Archery, and Baminton with instructional classes every quarter at UCSD.

# Projects 
Data Science, an emerging field over the past decade, is brimming with potential. I am eager to explore the intersections of this field with others and uncover the benefits it can bring to society's growth.

### FMP - 23-24 Academic School Year 
I am currently working with Professor [Justin Eldridge](https://eldridgejm.github.io/) on the quantification of depression diagnosis using EEG readings. Given the numerous confounds present in current diagnostic metrics, such as surveys, which are influenced by subjective ideals, our research aims to address these challenges.

# Other Experiences 

### FRC/FTC - Robotics Team Lead
Dates: 2019-2022

Led a 15-member team in the design, construction, and programming of a robot from inception. Competed in both the First Robotics Challenge and the First Tech Challenge, achieving recognition with the Judges' Award at the San Francisco Regional in 2022 during the First Robotics Challenge.

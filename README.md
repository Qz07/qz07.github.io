# Qirui Zheng (Sara)

Hi! I'm Sara, a current student at UCSD majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science specializing in Machine Learning and Neurocomputation, with a minor in Business Economics. I am interested in the intersection of Data Science with other domains. Currently looking to persue the path of Deep Learning and or Brain Computer Interfaces. The current algorithms are modeled to align with the neuro system in the brain, it contains many more potentials yet to be discovered. 

Apart from acedemics, I practice sports in Archery, and Baminton with instructional classes every quarter at UCSD.

# Projects 
Data Science, an emerging field in the past decade is full of potential. I am egar to discover how this field overlaps with others and the benifits that it can help a society grow towards in. 

### FMP - 23-24 Academic School Year 
I am currently working with Professor [Justin Eldridge](https://eldridgejm.github.io/) on quantifiying Depression diagoniss with EEG readings. Due to many confounds that may exist within current diagnostics metrics, such as suverys, it is influenced by many subjective ideals. 

# Other Experiences
